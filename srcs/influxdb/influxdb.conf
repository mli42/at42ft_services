### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.

  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores WAL files.
  wal-dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/wal"

  # The amount of time that a write will wait before fsyncing.  A duration
  # greater than 0 can be used to batch up multiple fsync calls.  This is useful for slower
  # disks or when WAL write contention is seen.  A value of 0s fsyncs every write to the WAL.
  # Values in the range of 0-100ms are recommended for non-SSD disks.
  # wal-fsync-delay = "0s"

  # The type of shard index to use for new shards.  The default is an in-memory index that is
  # recreated at startup.  A value of "tsi1" will use a disk based index that supports higher
  # cardinality datasets.

  # Trace logging provides more verbose output around the tsm engine. Turning
  # this on can provide more useful output for debugging tsm engine issues.

  # Settings for the TSM engine

  # CacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can
  # reach before it starts rejecting writes.
  # Valid size suffixes are k, m, or g (case insensitive, 1024 = 1k).
  # Values without a size suffix are in bytes.
  # cache-max-memory-size = "1g"

  # CacheSnapshotMemorySize is the size at which the engine will
  # snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory
  # Valid size suffixes are k, m, or g (case insensitive, 1024 = 1k).
  # Values without a size suffix are in bytes.
  # cache-snapshot-memory-size = "25m"

  # a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes

  # CompactFullWriteColdDuration is the duration at which the engine
  # will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a
  # write or delete
  # compact-full-write-cold-duration = "4h"

  # The maximum number of concurrent full and level compactions that can run at one time.  A
  # value of 0 results in 50% of runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) used at runtime.  Any number greater
  # than 0 limits compactions to that value.  This setting does not apply
  # to cache snapshotting.
  # max-concurrent-compactions = 0

  # will allow TSM compactions to write to disk. Note that short bursts are allowed
  # to happen at a possibly larger value, set by CompactThroughputBurst

  # TSM files. This setting has been found to be problematic on some kernels, and defaults to off.
  # It might help users who have slow disks in some cases.
  # tsm-use-madv-willneed = false

  # Settings for the inmem index

  # high cardinality issues at the database level.  This limit can be disabled by setting it to
  # 0.
  # max-series-per-database = 1000000

  # The maximum number of tag values per tag that are allowed before writes are dropped.  This limit
  # can prevent high cardinality tag values from being written to a measurement.  This limit can be
  # disabled by setting it to 0.
  # max-values-per-tag = 100000

  # Settings for the tsi1 index

  # The threshold, in bytes, when an index write-ahead log file will compact
  # into an index file. Lower sizes will cause log files to be compacted more
  # quickly and result in lower heap usage at the expense of write throughput.
  # Higher sizes will be compacted less frequently, store more series in-memory,
  # and provide higher write throughput.
  # Valid size suffixes are k, m, or g (case insensitive, 1024 = 1k).
  # Values without a size suffix are in bytes.
  # max-index-log-file-size = "1m"

  # The size of the internal cache used in the TSI index to store previously
  # calculated series results. Cached results will be returned quickly from the cache rather
  # than needing to be recalculated when a subsequent query with a matching tag key/value
  # predicate is executed. Setting this value to 0 will disable the cache, which may
  # lead to query performance issues.
  # This value should only be increased if it is known that the set of regularly used
  # tag key/value predicates across all measurements for a database is larger than 100. An
  # increase in cache size may lead to an increase in heap usage.
